# List of latest supported Windows XP SP3 software

Windows XP SP3 x86 offers decent compatibility of games of the period from the beginning of the Windows era,
up to the end of the 2000s (games of the DOS era are better to be run in the DOSBox).

Hardware from the 2000-s also just recently became "vintage", 
so it's totally possible to find a laptop from the late 2000s in a decent condition, 
or requiring minimal restoration and upgrade.

The advantage of the system is not only support of retro-games within 15-years period,
but also ability to run relatively modern software.

I have to note, that whatever the reason you use a system with official support ended 
and lack of security updates, 
avoid using it for internet browsing or any online exposure in general.
If possible, keep it cut from the Internet most of the time.

At the moment, my minimal list includes the following applications and updates:

* Latest security updates possible:
